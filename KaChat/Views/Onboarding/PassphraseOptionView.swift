/// Three screens rather than one. The old version was a single page of explainer cards with the
/// fields already on it and two buttons at the bottom, which asked someone to decide before it had
/// told them what they were deciding - and most people meeting this screen have never heard of a
/// passphrase. So it opens with the question, on its own, with a way to go and read about it
/// first:
///
///   1. `question` - "Did you create this seed with a passphrase?" (import only: creating opens on
///      the entry screen). Yes / No / What is a passphrase?
///   2. `entry` - the field, with the chatting address it produces and that address's balance
///      updating underneath as you type. That live address is the point: it is the only direct
///      evidence that a passphrase opens a DIFFERENT account rather than protecting the same one,
///      and a balance is how someone importing can tell they typed the right one.
///   3. `found` - import with no passphrase: the wallet these words were found in.
///   4. `explainer` - plain-language, back only, so reading about it always returns to the screen
///      it was opened from (the question, or the entry screen, which links it too).
///
/// The caller (`CreateWalletView` / `ImportWalletView`) performs the actual wallet commit via
/// `onProceed`, which receives the chosen passphrase ("" when there is none).
